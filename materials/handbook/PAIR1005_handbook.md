This module introduces the basic concepts and practices for evaluating and making inferences in social and political research. Students will be equipped with the vocabulary and basic logical framework required to critically assess and eventually produce academic social science research. This module serves as the basis for a subsequent module on research methods (PAIR 2004).


#### Summary of teaching and learning strategies

Focused, directed readings which students complete before each session will provide the core material around which each session will be organized. Each session will include a lecture providing a general overview of the main points which will be followed by discussion questions in response to which students will exercise their command of the material. These teaching and learning methods will achieve the aims and learning outcomes of the module by providing a focused, consistent, and supportive environment where students engage with the material in multiple ways (through reading, audible/visual lectures, and through their own speaking).

#### Aims and learning outcomes

Having successfully completed the module, students will:

- Students will gain an understanding of the types of research questions which can be asked of political phenomena (knowledge and understanding; subject specific intellectual).

- Students will learn the inherent problems and dilemmas of drawing inferences from data (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).

- Students will gain the working vocabulary required to think and speak about the quality and limitations of previous research (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).

- Students will gain a working knowledge of how to develop a research strategy given a research question (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).


#### Assessment

1. Students will respond to a series of in-class multiple-choice questions posed in lecture and/or seminar throughout the module. They will be automatically marked by the real-time feedback software (PollEverywhere) and worth 10% of the overall module mark.

2. Students will submit a research design proposal template at mid-semester (500 words) worth 40% of the overall module mark.

3. Students will submit a short research paper (1500 words) at the end of semester worth 50% of the module mark.

#### Re-sits

The student will re-write both essays following the same instructions as found on the [module handbook](http://jmrphy.net/media_politics/#assessment) but the word counts will be a maximum of 2000 words for the first essay and 2500 words for the second essay, and with two additional exceptions. As stated in the module handbook, the student is free to design their own essay questions so long as it pertains to the course material and the answer uses material and knowledge gained through the module. However, whereas the handbook states students may pursue the same question in both assessments to improve their first effort, students re-sitting this module must ask and answer different questions for each essay given that they will be doing them at the same time.  Also, if a student re-sitting prefers to have a question prompts, [the convenor](mailto:j.murphy@soton.ac.uk) will gladly provide one optional prompt per question to any students re-sitting the module.
