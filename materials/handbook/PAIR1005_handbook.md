This module introduces the basic concepts and practices for evaluating and making inferences in social and political research. Students will be equipped with the vocabulary and basic logical framework required to critically assess and eventually produce academic social science research. This module serves as the basis for a subsequent module on research methods (PAIR 2004).


#### Summary of teaching and learning strategies

Focused, directed readings which students complete before each session will provide the core material around which each session will be organized. Each session will include a lecture providing a general overview of the main points which will be followed by discussion questions in response to which students will exercise their command of the material. These teaching and learning methods will achieve the aims and learning outcomes of the module by providing a focused, consistent, and supportive environment where students engage with the material in multiple ways (through reading, audible/visual lectures, and through their own speaking).

#### Aims and learning outcomes

Having successfully completed the module, students will:

- Students will gain an understanding of the types of research questions which can be asked of political phenomena (knowledge and understanding; subject specific intellectual).

- Students will learn the inherent problems and dilemmas of drawing inferences from data (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).

- Students will gain the working vocabulary required to think and speak about the quality and limitations of previous research (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).

- Students will gain a working knowledge of how to develop a research strategy given a research question (knowledge and understanding; transferable and generic).


#### Assessment

1. In-class questions throughout the semester, worth 10% of final mark.   

2. Students will submit a research design proposal at mid-semester (500 words) worth 40% of the overall module mark.   

3. Students will submit a short research paper (1500 words) at the end of semester worth 50% of the module mark.   

#### Re-sits

By set coursework assignment(s). 2 x 1,000 word essays = 50% per assignment.
